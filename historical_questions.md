## Investigating Connections between Ms.Fr.640 and Estienne

### How did Estienne and the author-practitioner think about the natural world and humans’ place within it? Do their conceptions overlap, and if so how? If not, why (or how) not?

#### Question 1: 

What are our key words in each text? What parts of speech are the key words? Can key words be identified by frequency of use? How else might we identify words with significance to the meaning of the text?

#### Question 2: 
Are those key words shared between the two texts? How do they differ? How might we explain preferences for different vocabulary – jargon? Regional differences? Class differences?

#### Question 3: 
How are parts of speech used in each text? Does one text seem to rely more heavily on nouns, the other on adjectives, etc? Where does meaning (specificity, precision, detail) reside in the words of each text?

#### Question 4: 
Words in context: How does collation change our understanding of each author’s meaning? Do they use the same words in the same way? Are there phrases or terms of art that are used in particular ways?

#### Question 5: 
Themes: The body, the nation, god, foreignness/the “other” – what can we learn from word clustering around these themes in each text? (Revisit annotation for themes)
